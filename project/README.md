Write a simple expenses tracker web application

The user must be able to create an account and log in.
When logged in, user can see, edit and delete expenses he entered.
When entered, each expense has: date, time, description, amount, comment
User can filter expenses.
User can print expenses per week with total amount and average day spending.
Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is not an option.
REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend you can use Parse.com, Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
Bonus: unit tests!
You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.

NOTE: Please keep in mind that this is the project that will be used to evaluate your skills. The project will be evaluated as if you are delivering it to a customer. We expect you to make sure that the app is fully functional and doesn’t have any obvious missing pieces. The deadline for the project is 2 weeks from today.
